Hey {name},

Happy Birthday, you magnificent creature! Another year older, but let's be honest â€“ you're like a fine wine, getting better with age. Or maybe you're more like cheese... either way, you're tasty! (Wait, that came out wrong.)

Here's to another year of questionable decisions, embarrassing dance moves, and pretending we're still young enough to pull all-nighters. May your day be filled with cake, presents, and people pretending to laugh at your jokes.

Stay awesome, you old fart!
